# List of repositories that are under control of .NET CI.  
# Format is:
# One repo per line (org/repo format).
# Optional elements:
#   folder=folderName (special case <root> for root folder.  forward slashes to separate subfolders)
#   branch=branchName (branch that should be generated).  Should be bare branch name.
#       If ommitted, repo is not branch specific.  **Do not change this unless you know what you're doing**.
#       Talk to @mmitche first.
#       GithubBranchName is passed the value in branchName.
#       Unless the folder name is specifically specified, a folder is created underneath the repo folder.  If no branch is specified,
#       no branch folder is created.
